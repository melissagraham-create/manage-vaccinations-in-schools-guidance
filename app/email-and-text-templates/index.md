## Emails Mavis sends to parents

For scheduled sessions, Mavis automatically emails parents to:

- give information about the vaccines and ask for consent
- send reminders if they have not responded
- confirm consent responses
- share triage decisions (where relevant)
- remind them when sessions are happening
- confirm vaccination outcomes

You can see the consent request and reminder emails for each vaccination programme by selecting the relevant link in the menu on this page.

## Text messages Mavis sends to parents

If we have parents’ mobile numbers, Mavis also sends them text messages.

Mavis automatically sends texts to:

- ask for consent
- send reminders if parents have not responded
- confirm consent responses
- remind parentsthem when sessions are happening
- confirm vaccination outcomes

## Email templates for contacting schools

You can copy and edit these email templates to:

- request class lists from schools – this helps them send pupil information in the right format for uploading files into Mavis
- ask schools to check their details are up to date in Get Information about Schools (GIAS)
