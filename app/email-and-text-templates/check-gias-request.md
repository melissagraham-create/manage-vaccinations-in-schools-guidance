Dear ==name of school==,

Our vaccination management system uses information from Get Information about Schools (GIAS), the digital register held by the Department for Education (DfE) .

It’s important that your school’s details in GIAS are correct and up to date.

Please check your school’s GIAS record and update it if needed. In particular, make sure the following are accurate:
- unique reference number (URN)
- age range of pupils
- number of pupils
  
### How to update your GIAS record

To make changes, [sign in with your DfE Sign-in account](https://services.signin.education.gov.uk/). 
If you do not have access, ask your school’s DfE Sign-in approver. They can give access to colleagues.

### Find out more

For guidance and support, go to the [GIAS help page](https://get-information-schools.service.gov.uk/help). It includes a contact form and answers to common questions.
