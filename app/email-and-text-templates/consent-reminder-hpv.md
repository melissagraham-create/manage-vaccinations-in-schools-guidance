We wrote to you recently about a visit by a local health team to ==location name== on ==next session dates==.

If you want your child to get the HPV vaccination, you need to give consent by ==consent deadline==.

> [!NOTE]
> Do not reply to this email to tell us your decision. The link to the online consent form is below.

If you’ve already responded to the consent request, you can ignore this message.

### What the vaccine is for

The HPV vaccine helps protect against cancers caused by HPV, including:

- cervical cancer
- some mouth and throat (head and neck) cancers
- some cancers of the anal and genital areas

It also helps protect against genital warts.

The HPV vaccine works best if it’s given before young people become sexually active.
