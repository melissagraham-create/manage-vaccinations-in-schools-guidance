For scheduled sessions, Mavis emails parents to:

* give information about the vaccines and ask for consent 
* send reminders if they have not responded
* confirm consent responses
* share triage decisions (where relevant)
* remind them when sessions are happening
* confirm vaccination outcomes

If we have parents’ mobile numbers, Mavis also sends them text messages.

You can read the consent request and reminder emails for each vaccination programme by selecting the relevant link in the menu on this page.

>[!NOTE]
> We have also provided an email template you can use when requesting class lists from schools. This helps schools send pupil information in the correct format for uploading files into Mavis.
