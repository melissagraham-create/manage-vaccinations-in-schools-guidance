## Recording a new consent response

If you get a new consent response, for example, through a paper form, or verbally through a phone call, you can record this in Mavis.

1. From the **Consent** tab of a session page, go into the child record by clicking on their name.
2. Select **Record a new consent response**.
3. Use the radio button to indicate who the consent is from (you can add a new contact if necessary).
4. The parent’s details are displayed. Click **Continue** to enter a new consent response from that parent, then indicate whether it was given by phone, paper or in person.
5. Record their consent response and their answers to the health questions.
6. Select if it’s safe to vaccinate the child or choose one of the triage options.
7. Check and confirm the consent details and answers to health questions, and select **Confirm**.

## Updating a consent response 

You can change a consent response in Mavis:
- if a parent gets in touch to change their response 
- if a child needs a different vaccine from the one consented to, and you contact the parent to update their response

To change a consent response, you need to record a new response from the parent who gave the original response.

Follow the instructions from step 3 in **Recording a new consent response** to record the new response.

The new consent from the same parent will override the previous one.

## Withdrawing a consent response 
You should only withdraw a consent response if a parent previously gave consent but wants to withdraw it. 

1. Verify that the person contacting you is the original responder.
2. From the consent tab of a session page, go into the child record by clicking on their name.
3. Go to the parent’s consent response by clicking on the parent’s name.
4. Click on **Withdraw consent**.
5. Select the parent’s reason for withdrawing consent, add notes and click **Withdraw consent**.

## Marking a consent response as invalid

You should only mark a consent response as invalid if you have established that the person who responded does not have parental responsibility.

1. Verify that the consent response was recorded from someone who did not have authority to consent. 
2. From the consent tab of a session page, go into the child record by clicking on their name.
3. Go to the consent response by clicking on the name of the person who responded without authority to consent.
4. Click on **Mark as invalid**.
5. Add a note explaining why you are doing this and click on **Mark as invalid**.
