Mavis is designed to be used with complete age-based cohorts, including those already vaccinated in previous school years.

Before using Mavis for vaccination programmes, SAIS teams will need to:

- import full details of the cohort in the team’s area
- upload relevant historical vaccination records for all children in the cohort

We explain how to do this below.

## Uploading cohort records

> [!NOTE]
> You should upload cohort records before you upload vaccination records or class lists.

The cohort should include all children in your SAIS team’s area, as follows:

- all children in the target year (or years) for the vaccination programme, which is usually:
  - HPV - Year 8
  - MenACWY and Td/IPV - Year 9
  - flu and MMR(V) - all years from Reception (Year 0) to Year 11 (or up to Year 13 or 14 for Special Educational Needs schools, where applicable)
- all children in older year groups, up to Year 11, whether they have already been vaccinated or not

You’ll only need to upload the older year groups the first time you use Mavis. Once the cohort has been set up and used to record vaccinations for a particular year group, those records will stay in Mavis.

When children are taught outside their chronological year group, you’ll need to record this in either the cohort upload or class list upload - for more details, see ‘Handling out-of-year-group children’ below.

### What to include

You must include include the following information for each child in the cohort:

- unique reference number (URN) for their school (use 888888 for school unknown, or 999999 for home-schooled)
- first name
- last name
- date of birth
- postcode

The template below shows what other information can be imported into Mavis for child records.

{% from "attachment/macro.njk" import attachment %}
{{ attachment({
  text: "Cohort upload template",
  summary: "Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, 18 KB",
  href: "/files/cohort-upload-template.xlsx"
}) }}

If you haven’t included a child’s NHS number, we’ll retrieve it from the Personal Demographics Service (PDS) - Mavis [automatically searches PDS](importing-cohorts.md#see-how-mavis-uses-pds-to-find-nhs-numbers). to find a match for the child, using the information you’ve provided (their date of birth must be correct for this to work).

### Preparing files for upload

You can use the template provided below, or your own files as long as the headings and formatting match those in our template.

To upload files successfully:

- the cohort records must be in the format shown in the template above (note that for flu, Reception is Year 0 in Mavis)
- information marked as ‘Required’ in our template must be included for each child
- files need to be in .csv format
- if you have an Excel file with multiple tabs, you will need to consolidate this into a single tab before saving it as a CSV file, or create a separate CSV file for each tab
- make sure the file you’re uploading has no more than 10,000 rows

> [!NOTE]
> Large cohort files can fail to upload, due to their size. If your CSV file has over 10,000 rows, we recommend you split it into smaller files - for example 2 files with 5,000 rows.

### How to upload a cohort file

1. From the dashboard, go to **Import records** (or click on Imports in the top navigation).
2. Click on the **Upload records** button near the top of the page.
3. Select **Child records**, then click Continue.
4. Click on **Choose File**, then select the CSV file you want to import.
5. Click **Continue** and wait for the file to finish uploading.
  
### Checking the upload status
You can see whether your file was successfully uploaded by checking its status in the list of uploads. 

> [!NOTE]
> Upload times can vary - refresh the screen to see the latest status.

### Upload errors
If there are validation issues, Mavis will not import the file. It will stay in the **Incomplete imports** list with its status marked as **Invalid**.

To view the validation issues, click the file upload’s date and time.

![Screenshot of invalid upload.](/assets/images/invalid_import.png)

You should then:
- return to your CSV file and correct the issues listed
- save the changes and upload the file again

> [!NOTE]
> If less than 70% of records match an NHS number in PDS, the upload will be rejected, and you’ll see an error message. You should review the file, correcting any formatting issues (for example, make sure the first name and last name columns and the date of birth rows are in the correct position) and try uploading it again.

## Reviewing and approving uploads

After the file has uploaded, you must review and approve it before the records are imported into Mavis.

Select the upload date and time to open the review page.

![Screenshot of review screen for cohort import.](/assets/images/review-cohort-import.png)

When you upload child records, Mavis will identify children it already has records for.

### Records already in Mavis (no action needed)
When you upload child records, Mavis checks whether it already has a record for that child.

If a record is an exact duplicate, Mavis will simply not import it again. You’ll see a notification telling you how many records were not imported because they already exist in Mavis.

> [!NOTE]
>If the upload includes additional information about the child, such as their gender or preferred name, this information will be added to the existing record if you approve the upload.

### Close matches to existing  records (resolve after import)

If the upload includes close matches with existing child records, you’ll need to review them after you approve the upload.

Check the missing or conflicting details and decide which record to keep and which to archive. We explain how to do this below.

### School moves (resolve after import)

If the upload includes children who already have a record in Mavis for a different school, Mavis flags this as a school move.
Mavis also flags when a child moves to a school in your area from a school outside your area.

If you approve the upload, you must confirm the child’s school in the School moves area of Mavis.

If you confirm that the child has moved to a school in your area from another team’s area, the original team will be notified.
[Find out how to review and resolve school moves](/guide/school-moves/).

### Children with no known school already registered at a school in a different area (no action needed)

If the upload includes children with no known school who are already registered at a school (or registered as home-schooled) in another SAIS team’s area, Mavis will not import these records.

The records will remain with the other team and will not appear in your area.

If you upload the records again with updated school information, Mavis will import them as a school move if the school is in your area.

### Approving the upload (and further reviews)

To approve the upload and import the records into Mavis, select **Approve and import records**.

In some cases, you will need to do a **further review**. This happens if one or more records have changed since you uploaded the file.

For example, another import may have been approved that includes some of the same records, or a child’s school or NHS number may have changed in Mavis.

Review the changed records and confirm whether you still want to import them.

### Resolving close matches
You will need to review close matches and school moves after importing records.

If you confirm that the child has moved to a school in your area from another team’s area, the original team will be notified. [Find out how to review and resolve school moves](/guide/school-moves/).

Resolve close matches in the Imports area:
1. On the Imports screen, select the **Completed imports** tab. 
2. Select the upload by clicking on on its **date and time**.
3. Under ‘Close matches to existing records - needs review’, click the **upload issues** link to see a list of close matches.
4. Select **Review** for each record listed.
5. Select which version of the record you want to keep then select **Resolve duplicate**.

You can also choose to keep both child records. For example, Mavis may identify twins as a close match. If this happens, select **Keep both records**. The existing record will stay in Mavis and the uploaded record will be added.

If each record contains some correct information:

1. Note any correct information from the record you are not keeping.
2. Go to the record you are keeping and edit the information there.

Mavis also highlights if the NHS number you provided for a child is different from the NHS number held by PDS. If this happens, Mavis automatically replaces the incorrect NHS number with the correct one from PDS (see below).

> [!NOTE]
> You can view all unresolved close matches in the **Issues tab** on the Imports screen. This lists outstanding close matches from all uploads. 

## Handling out-of-year-group children

## See how Mavis uses PDS to find NHS numbers

Mavis may add a missing NHS number or replace an incorrect one in your upload by searching the NHS Patient Demographics Service (PDS) (sometimes referred to as ‘the Spine’).

If this happens, a PDS history link appears beside the NHS number in the child’s record.

![Screenshot of PDS history link on child record.](/assets/images/pds-history-link.png)

If there are any doubts or queries about the NHS number, you can see how Mavis found it by clicking the PDS history link.

The NHS number lookup history shows the different steps Mavis takes to search for the NHS number, and explains the search methods.
