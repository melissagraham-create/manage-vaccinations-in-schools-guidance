Any child can be vaccinated at a clinic. You can send invitations from Mavis (see below).

## Scheduling sessions in community clinics

Add all dates of all clinics to one session in Mavis. You cannot add specific clinic locations here. Those details are held in your local booking system.

To create dates for community clinics:

1. Go to **Sessions**.
2. Filter for **Unscheduled** sessions.
3. Go to the **Community clinic** link.
4. Click on **Schedule sessions**.
5. Follow the process as you would for school sessions.

To add or amend dates for community clinics:

1. Go to **Sessions**.
2. Filter for **Scheduled** sessions.
3. Go to the **Community clinic** link (there is just one for all clinics).
4. Go to **Edit session**.
5. Follow the process as you would for school sessions.

## Inviting parents to book slots

For a child to be vaccinated in a community clinic, you can invite their parent or guardian to book an appointment slot through your local booking system.

### If the child is home-schooled or their school is unknown

Mavis will automatically send an invitation email (and potentially a text message) to the parents or guardians of:

- home-schooled children
- children with an unknown school

The invitations will go out 3 weeks before the date of the first scheduled clinic unless you select a different date.

### If the child belongs to a school but did not get vaccinated there

Some children may have missed being vaccinated at a school session, for example if they were ill or on holiday at the time of the session.

To send clinic invitations to children who belong to a school, but were not vaccinated there:

1. Go to the sessions for schools that you are not going to return to in this vaccination programme
2. In each school session, go to the **Send clinic invitations** link. This will show you a summary of how many invitations will be sent out
3. Click the **Send clinic invitations** button

Mavis will send the invitations the next day.

### Inviting or moving individual children to clinic sessions

You can invite children to clinics or move them instantly to a clinic session by using the ‘Invite to community clinic’ button at the bottom of the child’s record.

The ‘Invite to community clinic’ button has 2 functions.

1. If you need to invite a child to a clinic (for example, if they are immunosuppressed and need to be prioritised for a flu vaccination, or you were unable to vaccinate them in a school session) click the button and an invitation will go out to the parents the next day.
2. If a child turns up at a clinic and is not on today’s session list, click the button and the child will be added to the session. If you vaccinate the child, no invitation will be sent.

### Sending booking reminders for clinics

To send booking reminders for subsequent clinics:

1. Go to **Sessions**
2. Filter for **Scheduled** sessions
3. Go to the **Community clinics** link
4. Go to **Send booking reminders**. This will show you a summary of children you can invite again to the next clinic
5. Click the **Send booking reminders** button

You will only be able to send clinic booking reminders to parents of children that have been invited for a previous clinic, but have still not been vaccinated. You can only send one invitation per child per clinic session date.

To check whether an invitation email has been sent:

1. Go to the **Consent** tab for a session.
2. Use the **No response** filter, then click on the name of a child to view the child record.
3. Click on **Session activity and notes**.

## Getting consent to vaccinate

You do not necessarily need to get consent in advance for clinics. If a parent accompanies a child to the clinic, their presence is considered implied consent.

If you choose to seek consent in advance, once a parent has booked a clinic slot through your local booking system:

1. In the **Community clinic** page, go to the **Consent** tab and filter for **No response**.
2. Click into the child’s record and scroll down.
3. Click on **Send consent request**.

This will trigger an email to the parent or guardian.

You could also try to get consent over the phone. To do this:

1. In the **Community clinic** page, go to the **Consent** tab and filter for **No response**.
2. Click into the child’s record.
3. Click on **Record a new consent response**.
4. Phone the parent and work through the consent flow to record their response in Mavis.
