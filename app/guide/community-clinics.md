Any child can be vaccinated at a clinic. Their parent or guardian will need to be invited to book a slot (see below).

## Scheduling sessions in community clinics

To create dates for community clinics:

1. Go to **Sessions**.
2. Filter for **Unscheduled** sessions.
3. Go to the **Community clinic** link.
4. Click on **Schedule sessions**.
5. Follow the process as you would for school sessions.

To add or amend dates for community clinics:

1. Go to **Sessions**.
2. Filter for **Scheduled** sessions.
3. Go to the **Community clinic** link (there is just one for all clinics).
4. Go to **Edit session**.
5. Follow the process as you would for school sessions.

## Inviting parents to book slots

For a child to be vaccinated in a community clinic, their parent or guardian will need to be invited to book an appointment slot through your local booking system.

### If the child is home-schooled or their school is unknown

An invitation email (and potentially a text message) will be sent automatically to the parents or guardians of:

- home-schooled children
- children with an unknown school

This will happen 3 weeks before the date of the first scheduled clinic.

### If the child belongs to a school but did not get vaccinated there

Some children may have missed being vaccinated at a school session, for example if they were ill or on holiday at the time of the session.

To send clinic invitations to children who belong to a school, but were not vaccinated there:

1. Go to **Sessions**
2. Filter for **Completed** sessions
3. Go to the relevant school session
4. Go to the **Send clinic invitations** link. This will show you a summary of how many invitations will be sent out
5. Click the **Send clinic invitations** button

### Inviting or moving individual children to clinic sessions

You can invite children to clinics or move them instantly to a clinic session by using the ‘Invite to community clinic’ button at the bottom of the child’s record.

The ‘Invite to community clinic’ button has 2 functions.

1. If you need to invite a child to a clinic (for example, if they are immunosuppressed and need to be prioritised for a flu vaccination, or you were unable to vaccinate them in a school session) click the button and an invitation will go out to the parents the next day.
2. If a child turns up at a clinic and is not on today’s session list, click the button and the child will be added to the session. If you vaccinate the child, no invitation will be sent.

### Sending booking reminders for clinics

To send booking reminders for subsequent clinics:

1. Go to **Sessions**
2. Filter for **Scheduled** sessions
3. Go to the **Community clinics** link
4. Go to **Send booking reminders**. This will show you a summary of children you can invite again to the next clinic
5. Click the **Send booking reminders** button

You will only be able to send clinic booking reminders to parents of children that have been invited for a previous clinic, but have still not been vaccinated. You can only send one invitation per child per clinic session date.

To check whether an invitation email has been sent:

1. Go to the **Consent** tab for a session.
2. Use the **No response** filter, then click on the name of a child to view the child record.
3. Click on **Session activity and notes**.

## Getting consent to vaccinate

Once a parent has booked a clinic slot through your local booking system, you need to make sure you have consent to vaccinate the child.

If you do not have consent, you need to manually send a consent request. To do this:

1. In the **Community clinic** page, go to the **Consent** tab and filter for **No response**.
2. Click into the child’s record and scroll down.
3. Click on **Send consent request**.

This will trigger an email to the parent or guardian.

You could also try to get consent over the phone. To do this:

1. In the **Community clinic** page, go to the **Consent** tab and filter for **No response**.
2. Click into the child’s record.
3. Click on **Record a new consent response**.
4. Phone the parent and work through the consent flow to record their response in Mavis.
