You can use the Programme area to download reports showing what vaccinations have been given in a specified period of time. You can share the downloads with your local CHIS team or GP practice.

You do not need to share reports for flu or HPV with GPs (except in some cases of self-consent), as [Mavis does this automatically](/guide/recording-vaccinations.md) but you still need to download and share reports with the local CHIS team.

## Download a vaccination report

To download vaccination reports:

1. Go to **Programmes**.
2. Select the programme you want to download a report for.
3. Click on **Download vaccination report**.
4. Enter a date range you want to download records for.
5. Click **Continue**.
6. Select the file format (CarePlus, SystmOne or CSV) you’d like to use for the download.
7. Click **Continue** to download the report.

> [!NOTE]
> **CarePlus** and **SystmOne** format downloads only include vaccinations given whereas the Mavis **CSV** format download also includes entries for children in the cohort who were not vaccinated.

## Data sharing between CHIS, SAIS and GP practices on SystmOne

### When CHIS uses SystmOne

Mavis sends vaccination records to GP practices using SystmOne. If your local CHIS provider also uses SystmOne, these records may automatically appear in the CHIS system. This depends on your local data sharing agreements.

If the child's GP uses EMIS Web or Medicus, the vaccination record will not automatically flow through to CHIS. You'll need to manually extract these records from Mavis and send them to CHIS.

### When SAIS uses SystmOne as an electronic patient record (EPR)

If you use SystmOne as an EPR system, vaccination data for children whose GP uses EMIS Web or Medicus will not flow through automatically. You'll need to manually extract these records from Mavis and upload them to the SAIS SystmOne system.
