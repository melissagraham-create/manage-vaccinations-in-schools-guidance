Mavis sends email and text reminders to parents who have not responded to the initial consent request.

Automatic reminders are sent 1 week before a session takes place. You can change this on the Edit session page (see [Scheduling and editing sessions](/guide/sessions.md)).

You can also send reminders manually. Mavis will then skip the next automatic reminder if it's due to be sent within 3 days.

1. Go to **Sessions**.
2. Find the session you’re interested in and select it.
3. On the **Overview** page, you’ll see how many children do not have a consent response. In the **Action required** block, select the **Send reminders** link. This takes you to the **Manage consent reminders** page.
4. On this page you can see how many parents have not responded. To send them a reminder, select the **Send manual consent reminders** button. Reminders are sent instantly.
