If your team uses patient specific directions (PSDs) for flu vaccinations, you can turn on this feature in Mavis to allow healthcare assistants to administer the nasal spray vaccine in a session.

1. Go to the relevant session in Mavis and select **Edit session**.
2. Find **Use patient specific direction (PSD)**. It’s set to No by default.
3. Select **Change** and set it to Yes.

Any user can turn this feature on for a session. Once it’s enabled, users with a prescriber role can add PSDs to named children (see [Reviewing and adding PSDs](/guide/reviewing-and-adding-psds/)).
