## Downloading a paper-based consent form

If you receive a request to send a parent a paper-based consent form, you can download and print the relevant form from Mavis.

1. Go to **Sessions**, then filter for **Scheduled** sessions.
2. Select the relevant session.
3. At the bottom of the **Overview** tab, in the **Session details** block, you’ll find a link to the consent form for each programme in the session. Select the link to download the form.
4. You can then print the form off and send it to the parent who requested it.

## Entering a consent response from a paper form

Once the parent returns the form, you can enter the information given into Mavis using the 'Record a new consent response' flow.

1. Go to **Sessions** and find the session you’re looking for. Select it.
2. Go to  the **Children** tab for this session and filter for **Needs consent**.
3. Go to into a child record by selecting their name.
4. Select **Record a new consent response**.
5. Use the radio button to indicate who’s responded.
6. Go through the consent flow, making sure to select **Paper** as the way the response was given.
