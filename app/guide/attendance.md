You can register children’s attendance at vaccination sessions in Mavis.

If this feature is enabled for your team, you can only record vaccinations for children who are registered as attending a session.

This feature can be switched off on the [Edit session page](/guide/sessions).

If you switch it off, all children with consent (and ‘safe to vaccinate’ triage outcomes, where relevant) will appear in ‘Record vaccinations’.

When a session is in progress, you can quickly see whether a child has been registered by looking at the **Registration status** shown on each child’s summary card.

To register a child as attending or absent:

1. Go to **Sessions**.
2. Filter for **In Progress** sessions.
3. Find the session you’re interested in and select it.
4. Filter for **Not registered yet**. You’ll see a list of all children who have not been registered yet.
5. Find the child’s name, then select the **Attending** or **Absent** button.

You can update a child’s attendance status if you need to, while the session is in progress.

1. From the **Children** tab, find the child whose attendance you want to update.
2. Select the **Attending** or **Absent** button to update their status.
