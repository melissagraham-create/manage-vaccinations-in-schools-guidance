## GPs and NHS England

All vaccinations recorded in Mavis are automatically shared with NHS England and GP practices.

You do not need to inform NHS England and GP practices of any vaccinations, except in cases where a child self-consented under Gillick competence and asked for their parents not to be notified (see below).

Once a child’s record has been added to Mavis, any school age vaccinations they get at a GP practice are automatically added to their record in Mavis.

> [!NOTE]
> You still need to send all vaccination records to CHIS. You should let your CHIS provider know that they do not need to send vaccination records to GP practices because Mavis does this automatically.

### Check whether a record has been shared

The child’s vaccination record in Mavis will show a **Synced** label when it was successfully synced with NHS England systems.

The record will show a **Sync pending** label if it’s in progress but not yet synced.

If a record cannot be synced, Mavis explains why and in some cases will tell you what action to take.

### Invalid or missing NHS numbers

Automatic sharing only works if the vaccination record includes a valid NHS number.

If the NHS number is invalid, the record:

- is not sent to NHS England or the child’s GP practice
- is flagged to superusers in important notices (see [Checking important notices](/guide/notices/))


If the NHS number is missing, the record:

- is sent to NHS England
- cannot be sent to the child’s GP practice
- is not flagged in important notices

### If a child self-consents under Gillick competence

If a child self-consents under Gillick competence and asks for their parents not to be informed, the record will not be synced and you must let the child’s GP know they were vaccinated. These records will be flagged to Superusers as an important notice - see [Checking important notices](notices.md).

## Sharing records with CHIS

You must share vaccination records for all programmes with CHIS manually.

To do this, download child-level vaccination reports as CSV files from the **Reports** area of Mavis and send them to your CHIS provider. For more information, read [Downloading vaccination reports](reporting.md).
