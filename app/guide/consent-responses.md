Mavis lets you review consent responses for each session.

1. Go to **Sessions**.
2. Filter for **Scheduled** sessions.
3. Find the session you’re interested in and select it.
4. Go to the **Children** tab.
5. Use the filters to see how many consents, refusals and conflicts you have. To see any children with conflicting consent responses, select **Has a refusal** then select **Conflicting consent** in the dropdown.
6. Click on a child’s name if you want to see more details about consent for that child.

For flu, if consent has been given, you’ll be able to see whether this is for:

- nasal spray only
- nasal spray, or injected vaccine if the nasal spray is not suitable
- injected vaccine only

## Reviewing children who’ve changed schools

When a parent submits a consent response, they can also let Mavis know that a child’s school has changed.

To review a child changing school, follow the instructions on this page of the user guide:

- [Reviewing school moves](/guide/school-moves)

## Reviewing unmatched consent responses

You can review unmatched consent responses across your whole cohort or for a specific session.

To see unmatched responses for the whole cohort, select **Unmatched responses** on the top navigation.

To see unmatched responses for an individual session:
1. Go to **Sessions**.
2. Find the session you’re interested in and select it.
3. Any unmatched responses will be flagged in the **Action required** block of the **Overview** tab. Select the link to display them.

### Matching responses
Once you’ve displayed the unmatched responses, try to match each child listed with an existing child record in Mavis.

1. Select **Match**.
2. You’ll be prompted to search for a child record that matches the child’s name. You can search by name or date of birth.
3. If you think you’ve found a match, select the child's name. This will display details from the consent response next to details from the existing child record.

4. If you believe it's a match, click **Link response with record**.

### If you cannot find a match
If you cannot find a match, you can **create a new child record** matching the details in the unmatched consent response. To do this, return to the page where you search for a child record that matches the child’s name and select **Create new record**.

Another option is to archive the unmatched consent response. To do this, return to the ‘Unmatched consent responses’ page and select **Archive** next to the relevant response.

## Investigating conflicting consent responses

If one parent gives consent for a vaccination and the other refuses, Mavis flags this as conflicting consent.

For flu, ‘conflicting consent’ can also mean that parents have given consent for different vaccines.

In both cases, you will need to investigate the conflicting consent and resolve it before the child can be vaccinated.

1. Go to **Sessions** and find the session you’re looking for. Select it.
2. In the **Children** tab for this session, filter for **Has a refusal** then select **Conflicting consent**.
3. If you click on the child’s record and scroll down, you’ll see who has said what in their consent responses.
4. Click on the name of the parent whose consent you want to investigate. This opens their consent response, including their contact details.
5. Contact the parent to discuss the conflicting consent.
6. If the parent changes their consent decision when you speak to them, add their new response to the child record manually (see [Recording a new consent response](/guide/add-or-remove-consent.md)).

## Investigating unknown parent contact details in consent response

If a consent response has different contact details from those on record, Mavis will automatically:

- record the consent decision
- add an additional parent to the child record with the new contact details
- contact the original parent to make sure the response came from somebody with parental authority

If the original parent informs you that the consent response came from somebody without parental responsibility, you need to:

- mark the consent response as invalid (see [Marking a consent response as invalid](/guide/add-or-remove-consent.md))
- remove the parent who sent the invalid response from the child record ([see Manually editing individual child records](/guide/editing-cohorts.md))
