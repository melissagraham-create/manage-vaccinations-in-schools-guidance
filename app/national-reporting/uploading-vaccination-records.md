## Preparing files to upload

Files must be in CSV format. If you have an Excel file with multiple tabs, you’ll need to consolidate this into a single tab before saving it as a CSV file, or create a separate CSV file for each tab.

You can include records from different vaccination programmes in the same file.

Any file that’s compatible with NIVS specifications will also be compatible with national reporting specifications.

> [!NOTE]
> The date in the DATE_OF_VACCINATION column must be the date the vaccination took place (not the date you are uploading the record, if you’re uploading it later).

For more detailed information about the columns that must be included in the CSV file, select **How to format your CSV file for vaccination records** on the Upload vaccination records page (see Uploading a file, below).

> [!NOTE]
> Large cohort files can fail to upload, due to their size. If your CSV file has over 10,000 rows, we recommend you split it into smaller files - for example 2 files with 5,000 rows.

## Uploading a file

1. On the **Imports** page, select **Upload records**.
2. Select **Choose file**, then select the CSV file you want to import.
3. Select **Continue**.
4. You can see the file’s status on the **Incompleted imports** list.

You may need to refresh the page to see the latest status.

> [!NOTE]
> You do not need to wait for one file to finish uploading before starting another upload.
>
> You can upload multiple files one after the other. Each file will appear in the Incomplete uploads list while it is being processed.

## Unsuccessful upload

If there are any validation issues, Mavis will not import the file. It will stay on the **Incomplete uploads** list with its status marked as invalid.

### Viewing and resolving upload issues

To view the validation issues, click on your file upload’s date and time stamp.

You should then:

- return to your CSV file and correct the issues listed
- save the changes and upload the file again

## Successful upload

If the file was imported successfully it will no longer be visible on the **Incomplete uploads** list. It will now be on the **Completed imports** list.

You can find it by selecting the **Completed imports** tab.

Mavis will automatically send imported vaccination records to NHS England.
